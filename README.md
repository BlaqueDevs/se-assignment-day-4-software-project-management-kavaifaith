## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope refers to the boundaries, deliverables, tasks, and objectives of a project. Clearly defining the scope helps teams:

Defining project scope & its importance in project planning
   - Set Clear Goals – Establish expectations for stakeholders and team members.
   - Avoid Scope Creep – Prevent unapproved changes that could delay the project.
   - Manage Resources Effectively – Allocate time, budget, and manpower wisely.
   - Improve Risk Management – Identify potential challenges early.
   - Ensure Stakeholder Alignment – Keep all parties on the same page.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. Each level of the WBS represents a more detailed view of the work, making it easier to assign responsibilities and track progress.
   - WBS is useful because it enhances project clarity – everyone understands what needs to be done.
   - Improves task prioritization – helps teams focus on critical tasks first.
   - Facilitates better scheduling – supports time estimation and deadline setting.
   - Minimizes project risks – identifies potential roadblocks in advance.
